Analysis Description
--------------------
BUSTED (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic
diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted jointly
to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide
evidence of episodic diversifying selection. Assuming there is evidence
of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1), BUSTED will also
perform a quick evidence-ratio style analysis to explore which
individual sites may have been subject to selection. v2.0 adds support
for synonymous rate variation, and relaxes the test statistic to 0.5
(chi^2_0 + chi^2_2). Version 2.1 adds a grid search for the initial
starting point. Version 2.2 changes the grid search to LHC, and adds an
initial search phase to use adaptive Nedler-Mead. Version 3.0 implements
the option for branch-site variation in synonymous substitution rates.
Version 3.1 adds HMM auto-correlation option for SRV, and binds SRV
distributions for multiple branch sets. Version 4.0 adds support for
multiple hits (MH), ancestral state reconstruction saved to JSON, and
profiling of branch-site level support for selection / multiple hits.
Version 4.2 adds calculation of MH-attributable fractions of
substitutions. Version 4.5 adds an 'error absorption' component
